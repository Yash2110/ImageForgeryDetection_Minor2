# ImageForgeryDetection_Minor2

Welcome to our Image Forgery Detection System project! In the digital age, image forgery has become a prevalent issue due to advanced technology and powerful editing tools. Authenticating the originality of images is challenging in various fields like forensics, medical imaging, industrial photography, and e-commerce. To address this, our project integrates cutting-edge algorithms and machine learning, including the ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) Algorithm for key point detection and displacement calculation. The system is designed with both frontend and backend code, ensuring a user-friendly experience. With the capability to identify common manipulations like copy-move, splicing, and retouching, our project aims to restore trust in digital images.
